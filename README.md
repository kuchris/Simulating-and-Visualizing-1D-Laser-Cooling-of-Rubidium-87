# Simulating-and-Visualizing-1D-Laser-Cooling-of-Rubidium-87

This project simulates the one-dimensional laser cooling of a Rubidium-87 atom using Doppler cooling with counter-propagating laser beams. By modeling velocity-dependent forces and stochastic photon interactions, it reveals how atomic motion slows and temperature decreases. Implemented in Python, it delivers a dynamic visualization to explore ultracold atomic physics. The simulation lays a foundation for advanced studies, with potential extensions to multi-dimensional or multi-atom systems.
